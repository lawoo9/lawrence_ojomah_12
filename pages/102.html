   <p>Any complication can develop during delivery - they are not always predictable.
    A facility has staff, equipment, supplies and drugs available to provide best care if needed, and a referral system.
    If HIV-infected she will need appropriate ARV treatment for herself and her baby during childbirth.
    Complications are more common in HIV-infected women and their newborns. HIV-infected women should deliver in a facility.
